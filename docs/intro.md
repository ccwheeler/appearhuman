# Introduction

- Operator's guide to the human suit
- Human Communication Guide
- a guide for visiting aliens

Hey there. I’m your fellow alien. Here trying to understand the world around me, the ape world that is.
If you feel you’re always living in a forge in country, then this is the book for you.

Aspegers sucks and learning to communicate is hard

A manual to learn how to be human, or a least appear like one. For aliens who struggle to fit in and want the black and white answers. For anyone wanting the guide to confidence in social situations, the no bullshit look on social heriarchies on why the humans do what they do.

> KNow the humans. Speak like the humans. Become one with the humans

Firstly know you are not alone. Many people who have lead exciting and wonderful lives - many of whom a lot of neurotypical people look up to, have ASD.
It is nothing to be ashamed of. Wear it with pride. For you understand your own machinery.
Some known people - Bill Gates, Bill Gross

Be proud of it for it explains a lot about you, how you differ, how you are unique. However it does not define you.
Some people are trying to find a cure for Autism - as if it is something to be cured, a disease. It’s not a disease, our brains just have differing programming.

#### I have felt...

- like I don't belong
- I'm not like other people deep down
- I've needed to hide who I am deep down to fit in
- afraid if people really knew me they would leave
- lonely even in a group

Other people can be sources of joy. Not just pain.
