#Masking
This is where we hide our ‘true selves’ from the world. Overdoing this is tiring, it can make us feel ashamed to be ourselves.

> Emotional expression - however much or however little is extremely difficult for me. The is because I am bursting inside with every emotion all at once. Of course, I cannot express it that way. I cannot really express my emotions without bursting, so I have to mask it to appear normal. My inner feelings are unlimited, but my mind only lets me express extremes or nothing. || Ethan Lisi
