# Questions are criticisms, sometimes

Ever had those times where you’re asking someone clarifying questions about their actions and they get all flustered and upset? Maybe it even turns into an argument. To you it came totally out of nowhere. There you were simply asking about the truth.
Well, when you ask people about their actions and things they did, even if the outcome wasn’t necessarily ‘bad’ they feel you are criticising them. They feel you are on what they call ‘a high horse’ - meaning that you think you’re better than they are.
To question in their mind is a social game of proving you are better than them. This is especially clear to them if others are present.
