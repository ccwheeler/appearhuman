#Social Posturing

“Who is on top of the heap socially, who is cool who is not”. When I go to school I want to go to school, I’m not there to socialise. I don’t mind socialising but I don’t want to be at the top or bottom of the heap, I don’t wanna be anywhere. Who cares who’s cool and who’s not? - well that is not the way most people think.

Wherever there’s a group of people, people like to be the big shot. People like to think they are a little bit above everyone else. - to be respected. They will try to achieve that sometimes by abusing other people through ostracising

Sometimes they are reacting to us, sometimes they feel we are ostracising them. With selective mutism, they feel you’re being arrogant/ stuck up, not talking to them out of choice. “They don’t like me (by not speaking to me) so I won’t like them either”
Take into consideration (do not self blame)
We not doing something nefarious, but we are creating unintentionally / initiating the reaction because we don’t know how to socialise. It puts the blame on us, but it also puts the blame on the other person for they are not responding appropriately. - but then again we are not acting appropriately due to the standards of the neurotypical community

Just not socialist anymore isn’t the answer, if you’ve been in a car accident, does this mean you should never drive again?
